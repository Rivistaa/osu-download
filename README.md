# About
Have you ever wanted to download all the ranked osu!standard beatmaps between a certian star range? Well, this sketchy combination of python scripts is for you!

Recently a major beatmap hosting site commonly known as Bloodcat has passed away, and with that, the owner released their json beatmap database. Using this database we can quickly filter beatmaps to our liking and download them from another beatmap mirror site. Namely Beatconnect.


# Usage
So how do I use this marval of technology? Well, it should function to some degree as long as you have python3 installed on your device. 

1. Download the bloodcat database [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jKdWteCHC3o4HCwYFjD8OF3-G6wKZSPB/view?usp=sharing)
2. git clone
3. Place the database in the same directory as the scripts and name it osu.json
4. Change what you want at the top of filter.py
5. Run filter.py
6. run download.py (takes forever)
7. ???
8. all the osz files should be in /output/ ready for you to import to osu

# Bugs
So you found a bug, or are having an issue using the downloader. What do you do?
Please open an issue and I'll do my best to help you out where I can. This script was quickly thrown together and only loosly tested, so I expect it to likely have some issues.
